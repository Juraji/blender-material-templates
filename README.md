# Blender Material Templates
This is a VERY specific plugin, fulfilling a VERY specific task.

_(It allows for templating materials and modifiers given specific mesh names.)_  
I am setting it to public, just to share the code and ideas. I will eventually write a propper readme, and who knows, it might come in handy for more people.
